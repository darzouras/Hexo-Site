## Getting Started

In order to run this program all you have to do is run
```
npm install
hexo server
```
The page will run on localhost:4000 by default.


## Deploying

I can't believe how easy it is to deploy this website.

```
hexo generate -d
```

The public folder is created and then it is deployed based on instructions in the outermost _config.yml file.
