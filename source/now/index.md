## Professionally

Building TONS of websites for Fusion Marketing in St Louis. Recently launched a redesign for [GooseIsland.com](https://gooseisland.com). Working on redesigns for multiple [Friedkin Group](https://friedkin.com) properties.

Building in ModX primarily, learning Statamic, sometimes dabbling in Angular or Vue, and taking every advantage possible to build static and serverless.

## Personally

Recently married on October 1st to my husband! We live near St. Louis with a fluffy black cat and a corgi-mix. We are constantly buried in hair.

Trying to get back into drawing and painting in my spare time.
