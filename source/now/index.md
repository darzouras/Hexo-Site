## Professionally

Building TONS of websites for Fusion Marketing, an experiential marketing firm of Endeavor Global Marketing in St Louis. Recently launched a redesign for [GooseIsland.com](https://gooseisland.com). Working on redesigns for multiple [Friedkin Group](https://friedkin.com) properties.

Building in ModX primarily, learning Statamic, sometimes dabbling in Angular or Vue, and taking every advantage possible to build static and serverless.

Passing on my knowledge of CSS magic to the rest of the team.

## Personally

Recently married to my partner of nearly 5 years! We live near St. Louis with a fluffy black cat and a corgi-mix. We are constantly buried in hair.

Making different versions of this website over and over again instead of getting back into drawing and painting.

Dreaming of a day when I can work from home so I can hang out with my furry babies 24/7.
