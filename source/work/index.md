## Fusion Marketing

May 2017 - present, Jr Application Developer, [thisisfusion.com](https://thisisfusion.com)

I work on a small B2C team that addresses the tech needs at an experiential marketing firm. My primary role is web developer and I'm regarded as the front-end expert. The project managers refer to me as the Website Queen.

While with Fusion I have built and maintained websites using ModX, WordPress, NodeJS, Vue, and Angular. Although a majority of the team's activations are short lived, my websites are permanent and require maintenance over the long term.

As an experiential marketing company I am exposed to technologies used by companies like Anheuser Busch, Coca Cola, and Blizzard. I work closely with the creative team and brand ambassadors in order to best satisfy the client.

Projects assigned to my team usually have tight deadlines so I have become used to quickly solving problems and staying focused. I've never missed a deadline.
