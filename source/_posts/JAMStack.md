Okay, so, considering how much I love this kind of development, it's kind of embarrassing that I had no idea that it was a *thing*. Watching [this talk by Chris Coyier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXJpOHz3_sY) is what made me aware of it. Since then I've taken every chance possible to ditch back end development and build websites using the JAMstack.

So far I've used static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) and didn't even realize that I was familiar with a great tool to push static websites live: [Surge](https://surge.sh). Most recently I'm rebuilding my portfolio (this blog right here!!!) using [Hexo](https://hexo.io).

If you're interested in learning more [Power of Serverless](https://thepowerofserverless.info/) is my go-to resource.
