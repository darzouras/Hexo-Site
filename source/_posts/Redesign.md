The Fusion Digital B2C team was tasked with completeley rebuilding the [Goose Island Website](https://gooseisland.com) and I was the lead developer. A very short timeline that spanned the holidays made this project especially challenging but also a lot of fun.

The design on this website features lots of tasteful negative space, large graphics, and a theme-changing Easter egg.

This project was completed mid January 2019.
